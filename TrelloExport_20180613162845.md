**Description:**

# Blockchain Hub Prague

### A collaborative environment for projects to synergize and succeed.

> Blockchain Technology Hub s.r.o. was conceived and launched in September 2017 by Tom Counsell (RPCV Morocco) and Ethan Clime (RPCV Moldova). The original vision was to simply create a space for our 3 startups to share the overhead costs of managing an office to support our staff and growing businesses. As an additional goal, we aimed to create awareness around blockchain technology in the Karlin financial district, and attract talented professionals to work for our companies. 

> Since realization of this vision, the scope of what is now known as “Blockchain Hub Prague” (on Facebook and Google Maps) has grown to include a wider set of initiatives and dreams. Tom Counsell has taken ownership and directorship over the Hub so that it can achieve it’s far-reaching goals into the next decade. Four categories represent the operational scale and impact envisioned for the future: Incubation, Education, Community, and Engineering R&D.

### [2] Advisement, Mentoring



**Description:**

# Advisement

> Startup advisement involves a regular schedule of meetings that generally focus on the most urgent and important company needs. This may cover topics such as investor pitching, cash-flow, hiring/firing, product-market fit, etc. The Hub provides advisors for each startup for the explicit and singular purpose of aligning startups on a path towards success.

> The owner and operating management of Blockchain Hub reserve the right to monitor and advise all startups under the incubator membership agreement. (with exception to founding startups ITF, Crowdholding, Aztrana)

# Mentoring

> Mentoring relationships provide value to both the mentor and the mentee and are often a key to success for young leaders.

> Those holding executives or leadership roles within the Hub community and member startups are highly encouraged to personally mentor the founders of new startups joining the Hub. This is at the discretion of the new startup and mentors may be purely voluntary or given equity, tokens, or any other form of remuneration. Blockchain Hub will monitor mentoring relationships, but otherwise take no commission, nor interfere except in the rare case of conflict determined via the Hub's "Advisement" role.

# Other

> Other advisor, mentor, investor, partner, or other relationships may always be established between members and individuals. While Blockchain Hub would like to be generally aware how people are helping each other, reporting is not a requirement unless stipulated in a membership agreement. In all things providing an environment for synergy to naturally arise between members is the main goal.
